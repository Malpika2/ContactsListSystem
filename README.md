TBLTECHNERDS Final Exam (JS Developers)

## How is it done?

I Used:
- Express for server
- Nodemailer for send the emails
- Node-localStorage for storage the data
- passport for Authentication
    
## Files importants
The data store in /scratch files, dont remove. 


## Installation ##
Using a terminal prompt in the same folder as the package.json file you simply need to run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

## Start 
To start the server, run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```
